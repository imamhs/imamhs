- 👋 Hi, I’m Imam
- 👀 I’m interested in data modelling and simulation using numerical techniques
- 👀 I’m experienced in Linux development, distributed networking systems design, application of simulations, software architecture streamliming and abstraction, just to name few 
- 👀 I’m interested in computer simulation, system design, data modelling, gaming, Linux, operating systems and many more
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux based systems design and deployment
- 👀 I’m interested in high level abstractions and system specification and design for efficiency
- 🌱 One of things I’m currently learning is numerical data predicting and structure
- 💞️ Are you interested in collaborating on the above things?
